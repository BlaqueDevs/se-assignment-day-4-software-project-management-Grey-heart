Waterfall: Structured, predictable, but inflexible to changes and slower in feedback.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements mostly large scale projects , like app development.
Waterfall: Best for projects with fixed requirements and well defined scopes sice going back to a previous stage will or might cause cost overrruns , such as regulatory software.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods: Automated testing, code reviews, user testing, continuous integration.
Maintaining high standards ensures reliability, user satisfaction, and reduces defects.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Clear scope defines goals, preventing scope creep and aligning team efforts.
